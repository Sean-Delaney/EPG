Stephen Sackur speaks to the exiled leader of the anti-Lukashenko movement Svetlana Tikhanovskaya.</desc>

<title lang="en-GB" >The Mystery of Anthrax Island</title>
<desc lang="en-GB">Anthrax is a rare disease caused by naturally occurring bacteria which can form spores that are fatal to humans and animals. During the Second World War, government scientists from Porton Down attempted to weaponise anthrax, creating a deadly strain that they then tested on Gruinard Island, an uninhabited remote site off the coast of Scotland. This proved disastrous for Gruinard and, from 1942 onwards, people were forbidden from setting foot on the island.</desc>
